💡 **********If you had an extra two weeks for this project, what feature(s) would you add**********
- I would add figures in the table of products, so the user can better understand details of the options
- I would improve the styling of the additional window made, as for now it has a very poor HTML styling
- I would try to align the table options to the middle of the box-element
- The pages are not responsive. They work well in big screens, but for phones they would need some refinement

💡 ********************************************************The thing I like the least about Javascript is…********************************************************
- JQuery. And JSON. And AJAX. I am still catching up with all the technologies and resources behind JavaScript and I confess that trying to understand all of them at the same time has been extremely excruciating for me. Nevertheless, It is always rewarding when I get to see my code working in a web page. 
- I also don’t like how hard it gets to test things with JavaScript. Since I am used and dependent on compilers for C and C++, I feel like I am re-learning how to ride a bike now that I have to test things on JS.
